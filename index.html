    <div class="dark-blue-border">
        <p>The wolf, also known as the grey wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America.
            More
            than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, including the dog and dingo, though grey wolves,
            as
            popularly understood, only comprise naturally-occurring wild subspecies. The wolf is the largest extant
            member
            of the family Canidae, and is further distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and
            muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to
            smaller
            Canis species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them. The wolf's
            fur is
            usually mottled white, brown, grey, and black, although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all
            white.
        </p>
        <p>Of all members of the genus Canis, the wolf is most specialised for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated
            by
            its physical adaptations to tackling large prey, its more social nature, and its highly advanced expressive
            behaviour, including individual or group howling. It travels in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair
            accompanied by their offspring. Offspring may leave to form their own packs on the onset of sexual maturity
            and
            in response to competition for food within the pack. Wolves are also territorial, and fights over territory
            are
            among the principal causes of mortality. The wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds on large wild hooved
            mammals
            as well as smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage. Single wolves or mated pairs typically have
            higher
            success rates in hunting than do large packs. Pathogens and parasites, notably the rabies virus, may infect
            wolves.</p>
        <p>The global wild wolf population was estimated to be 300,000 in 2003 and is considered to be of Least Concern
            by
            the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Wolves have a long history of interactions with
            humans, having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities because of their attacks on livestock,
            while conversely being respected in some agrarian and hunter-gatherer societies. Although the fear of wolves
            exists in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals
            suffering from rabies. Wolf attacks on humans are rare because wolves are relatively few, live away from
            people,
            and have developed a fear of humans because of their experiences with hunters, farmers, ranchers, and
            shepherds.
        </p>
        <p>The English "wolf" stems from the Old English wulf, which is itself thought to be derived from the
            Proto-Germanic. The Proto-Indo-European root may also be the source of the Latin word for the animal lupus
            The
            name "grey wolf" refers to the greyish colour of the species. Since pre-Christian times, Germanic peoples
            such
            as the Anglo-Saxons took on wulf as a prefix or suffix in their names. Examples include
